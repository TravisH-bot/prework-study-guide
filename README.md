# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was designed around teaching the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript:

- The motivation behind the project was to familiarize myself with the basic fundamentals of each language and a basic understanding of Git and GitHub.
- The project was created to to help me begin the process of thinking like a developer, coding, problem solving, and familiarizing myself with the process of updating and maintaining a webpage through Git and GitHub.
- Through this website, I will be able to store notes on the topics we have covered so far in the prework as reference for future use in the coding bootcamp and beyond.
- So far, through the prework course, I have brushed up on my HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript skills. While already having some coding experience beyond the prework, it's been a while since I've coded and I have learned some proper fundamentals that were missed out on. The information on Git and GitHub has been especially informative.
